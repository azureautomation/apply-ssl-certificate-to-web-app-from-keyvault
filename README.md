Apply SSL Certificate to Web App from Keyvault
==============================================

            

Extracts a SSL Certificate out of Azure Keyvault and applies it as a SSL Binding to an Azure Web App.


Ideally this script should be used in combination with this script which obtains the SSL Certificate from Lets Encrypt.

Prerequisites are;


  *  Custom domain has already been configured in the Web App 
  *  Certificate already exists in Keyvault 

 

 

 


        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
